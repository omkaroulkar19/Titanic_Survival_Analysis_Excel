## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic Dataset (from Kaggle) to identify the key factors that influenced passenger survival rates during the RMS Titanic disaster. The primary objective is to use data exploration and visualization in **Microsoft Excel** to uncover survival patterns based on passenger demographics and travel details.

---

## 💾 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information for 891 passengers and includes the following key variables:

* **Passenger Demographics:** PassengerId, Sex, Age, Title
* **Socio-Economic Factors:** Pclass (Passenger Class)
* **Travel Details:** SibSp (Number of Siblings), Parch (Number of Parents), Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
* **Outcome Variable:** Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
1.  **Identify High-Risk Passenger Groups:** Determine which groups (by gender, age, or social class) were most affected.
2.  **Analyze Social Structures:** Understand how factors like passenger class and family size impacted survival.
3.  **Derive Safety Recommendations:** Provide data-driven advice to help improve modern maritime safety rules and evacuation plans.

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions
* What was the overall survival rate of the passengers?
* How much did gender affect the chances of survival?
* Which age groups (children, adults, or seniors) were most at risk?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
* **Microsoft Excel**
* **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** Handled missing values (Age, Embarked), removed unnecessary columns, and created new columns (Title).
* **Data Analysis (Pivot Tables):** Aggregated data to analyze survival rates across different categories.
* **Data Visualization (Pivot Charts):** Used bar charts and pie charts to visually represent findings.
* **Interactivity (Dashboard & Slicers):** Allowed for dynamic filtering and data exploration.

---

##  deliverables
* Cleaned Excel dataset
* Pivot tables, charts, and the final dashboard
* Final summary report (Word document)

---

## 💡 Insights (Sample Findings)

> * **Overall Survival:** About **38%** of passengers survived.
> * **Gender:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate.
> * **Age:** Children had a higher survival rate than seniors.
> * **Class:** First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
* Incorporate additional variables (like fare or total family size).
* Rebuild the analysis as an interactive Power BI dashboard.
