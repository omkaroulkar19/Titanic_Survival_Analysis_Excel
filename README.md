## 📘 Project Overview  

This project analyzes passenger data from the **RMS Titanic disaster** using the **Titanic Dataset** (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)).  
The goal is to identify **key factors that influenced survival rates** by performing **data exploration and visualization in Microsoft Excel**.  
Through this analysis, patterns in survival are uncovered based on **passenger demographics**, **social class**, and **travel details**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description  

The dataset contains information for **891 passengers** with the following key variables:

| Category | Columns | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Passenger Demographics** | PassengerId, Sex, Age, Title | Basic details of each passenger |
| **Socio-Economic Factors** | Pclass | Passenger Class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower) |
| **Travel Details** | SibSp, Parch, Embarked | Family members onboard & port of embarkation |
| **Outcome Variable** | Survived | 0 = Did Not Survive, 1 = Survived |

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives  

The primary goals of this analysis are to:

1. **Identify High-Risk Passenger Groups** – Determine which demographics were most affected during the disaster.  
2. **Analyze the Impact of Social Structures** – Understand how factors like passenger class and family size influenced survival.  
3. **Derive Actionable Safety Recommendations** – Use the data insights to inform modern maritime safety practices and evacuation strategies.

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions  

Some of the analytical questions explored include:

1. What was the overall survival rate of passengers?  
2. How did **gender** affect survival chances?  
3. Which **age group** (children, adults, or seniors) was most vulnerable?  
4. Did **passenger class (Pclass)** have a significant impact on survival?

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques  

| Task | Tool / Technique |
|------|------------------|
| **Data Cleaning** | Power Query – handled missing values (Age, Embarked), removed unnecessary columns, created a new “Title” column |
| **Data Analysis** | Pivot Tables – aggregated data to explore relationships between survival and demographic factors |
| **Data Visualization** | Pivot Charts (Bar, Pie, Column) – visualized survival trends |
| **Interactivity** | Excel Dashboard – used Slicers for dynamic filtering and exploration |

---

## 📦 Deliverables  

- ✅ Cleaned and processed Excel dataset  
- ✅ Pivot Tables and Visual Charts  
- ✅ Interactive Excel Dashboard  
- ✅ Final Word Report summarizing findings  

---

## 💡 Insights & Findings  

| Observation | Insight |
|--------------|----------|
| **Overall Survival Rate** | ~38% of passengers survived |
| **Gender Effect** | Females had significantly higher survival rates |
| **Age Group Analysis** | Children had better survival chances than seniors |
| **Class Influence** | First-class passengers were more likely to survive than lower-class ones |

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  

- Add additional variables such as **Fare** or **Family Size** for deeper insights  
- Rebuild the dashboard using **Microsoft Power BI** for advanced interactivity and better visuals
